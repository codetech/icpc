BlastRadius
  - Has X/Y/Radius

GameMap
  - Represent cells with an ArrayList of strings
  - Progressively add cells
  - After first line, set width
  - Calculate an X/Y position with ((width*y)+x)
  #getBlastRadii
    - For each M and B
      - Generate vectors (X/Y's) to Z's
      - Determine the set of radii sufficient to intersect
        the edges of these vectors
        - Specifically, that's sqrt(pow(x,2)+pow(y,2))
    - Return an array of BlastRadius objects
  #doesIntersectZombies
    - Given a radius, return true if all zombie vectors are less than or
      equal to the radii of all mines

Create a GameMap.
Get its blast radii.
Sort the radii by smallest.
For each radii, check if it doesIntersectZombies. If true, print it.
